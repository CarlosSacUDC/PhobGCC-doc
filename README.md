# PhobGCC Documentation Hub
This is a central location for documentation for the PhobGCC.

The PhobGCC is a replacement motherboard for Gamecube controllers that reads stick position using magnets and Hall effect sensors instead of potentiometers that can wear out.
It offers an advanced digital snapback filter that doesn't reduce responsiveness and actually improves responsiveness in Melee.
It also features gate calibration, swappable buttons, and facilitates installation of discrete switches on the D-pad and face buttons.

This comes together to make a high-performance, customizable, long-lasting controller that you can make yourself.
